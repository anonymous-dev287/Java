Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Definition:
A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Explanation:
You should be able to add new cricket player roles without modifying the existing code.

Example (Bad):

class Player {
    public void play(String role) {
        if (role.equals("Batsman")) {
            System.out.println("Playing as Batsman");
        } else if (role.equals("Bowler")) {
            System.out.println("Playing as Bowler");
        }
    }
}
Adding a new role (e.g., WicketKeeper) would require modifying the play method.
