1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Definition:
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.

Explanation:
Each class should focus on one aspect of cricket.

Example(Bad):
class CricketTeam {
    public void selectPlayers() {
        System.out.println("Selecting players for the match.");
    }

    public void scheduleMatch() {
        System.out.println("Scheduling the cricket match.");
    }
}
The CricketTeam class has two responsibilities: selecting players and scheduling matches.
